\title{Comprehensive pipeline and other utility and visualization functions}
\description{
If you have a matrix (either produced by Cellranger or a txt file), this
package can help you run a processing pipeline, which includes removal of
doblets, ambient RNA, adaptive low-quality cell filtering using the MAD.
Other add ons include estimation of the proper clustering resolution based 
on the silhouette coefficients. The pipeline within this package will also
output plots and stats not tipically included in the Seurat workflow such
as complexity and N most highly expressed gene boxplots. We also facilitate 
the conversion of the output Seurat object into .h5ad format so that your
data will be compatible with python workflows.
