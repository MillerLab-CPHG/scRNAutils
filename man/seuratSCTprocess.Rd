\arguments{
\item{seuratObj}{An input Seurat object.}

\item{libraryID}{A character indicating name of the sample.}

\item{studyID}{A character indicating name of the study.}

\item{tissueSource}{A character indicating arterial bed of the library.}

\item{nMADs}{A character indicating the number of Median Absolute Deviations (MADs)
to be used during joint metric filtering (nUMIs, nGenes, %Mito, %Ribo)}

\item{minReads}{A numeric indicating min number of UMIs to keep.}

\item{maxReads}{A numeric indicating max number of UMIs to keep.}

\item{minFeatures}{A numeric indicating the minimum number of genes cells should express to be included.}

\item{maxFeatures}{A numeric indicating the maximum number of genes cells should express to be included.}

\item{maxMtPercent}{A numeric indicating the max percentage of reads mapped to the mito genome.}

\item{maxHbPercent}{A numeric indicating the max percentage of reads mapped to hemoglobin genes.}

\item{diseaseStatus}{A character indicating the disease status of the library (e.g., non-lesion, lesion).}

\item{age}{A character vector indicating age of the subject.}

\item{sex}{A character vector indicating sex of the subject.}

\item{race}{A character vector indicating race of the subject.}

\item{seqPlatform}{A character indicating the sequencing platform}

\item{regressMitoRibo}{A boolean indicating whether to regress out Mitochondrial variance or not.}

\item{rmMitoRiboVarGenes}{A boolean indicating whether we should remove Mito and Ribo genes from 
the set of highly variable features.}

\item{seuratFilter}{A boolean indicating whether we wish to filter low quality cells. 
Set to FALSE in pre-processing round for doublet removal.}

\item{setAutoThreshold}{A boolean indicating whether we should do adative thresholding for removing
low quality cells. This approach uses the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD).}

\item{autoSelectPCs}{A boolean indicating whether to determine the number of PCs in a data-driven way.}
}
\value{
A seurat object that has been SCT normalized, nearest neighbors graph and UMAP embeddings.
}
\description{
Internal helper function to standardize filtering, SCT normalization
and dimensionality reduction. This function will also add
some important metadata variables.
